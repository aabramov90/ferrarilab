### Associate Research Scientists

\

![](images/esti.png){width=25%}

#### *Esti Castillero, PhD*

I am a Biomedical Researcher with a PhD in Physiology and Endocrinology. My research focuses on the study of the advanced stages of myocardial and cardiac valve remodeling. My research argues that cardiac remodeling is regulated both at a local and systemic level and that it may, in turn, affect remote tissues by endocrine crosstalk. \

Currently, I am leading projects that explore myocardium-cardiac valve communication in the adaptation to ischemic injury and the role of circulating factors from the skeletal muscle in cardiac remodeling in end-stage heart failure.

 Expandable Polymeric-valved Conduit to Repair Congenital Heart Disease 

The proposed research is relevant to public health because a biostable polymeric valved conduit that can be implanted surgically to reconstruct the right ventricular outflow tract in neonates and infants and then expanded by successive transcatheter procedures to reach the adult size, would revolutionize how we treat children with heart valve diseases. Such a new generation of valved conduit would decrease the number of open-heart surgeries and reoperations, decrease the mortality, complications and healthcare costs related to these procedures and increase the life expectancy and quality of life of these patients.

### Micheal S Sacks PhD\

*University of Texas at Austin*

![](images/sacks.jpg){width=25%}

The bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common cardiac congenital anomaly. Due to the widespread availability and routine use of screening echocardiography, development of clinical methods for the identification of asymptomatic young patients with BAV is now realistic. We thus plan to develop sensitive, clinically derivable functional indices that will yield clinically relevant patient- specific strategies for identifying BAV patients at high risk.\

Identification of Molecular Pathways that Protect Against Atherosclerosis
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of cardiovascular death worldwide. Current treatments for CAD include lifestyle modifications and medical therapies to reduce its risk factors. When these methods fail, more invasive interventions, such as placement of a stent to restore blood flow or performance of a coronary artery bypass graft surgery, are used. This latter procedure aims at bypassing the blocked area using either veins or arteries. The use of arterial grafts is associated with a better long-term patency and a reduced rate of progression of atherosclerosis when compared to vein grafts. Yet, the exact molecular mechanisms by which arteries are protected from disease progression are not well understood. This study aims to identify the underlying mechanisms that render arteries resistant to atherosclerosis.\
