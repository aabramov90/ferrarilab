First-generation graduate (U of Pavia, 2003), I am a group leader and Associate Professor (with tenure) at Columbia University, Dept. of Surgery and Biomedical Engineering. I am Scientific Director of the Cardiothoracic Research Program and Director of the Columbia Biobank for Translational Science, an applied biobank supporting translational and precision medicine initiatives. Heart valve and vascular cell physiology, cardiac mechanobiology, materials science in medical devices, and the brain-heart axis are my main research interests.

![](images/xue.JPG){width=25%}

Dr. Yingfei Xue is currently a postdoctoral research scientist in Dr. Giovanni Ferrari lab at Columbia University. He obtained his PhD degree from [University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy](http://www.pharmacy.pitt.edu/research/research_index.php). His research interest is centered around cardiovascular implants including bioprosthetic valves, conduits, and patches. His research goal is to understand the mechanisms of cardiovascular implant failure and improve implant durability. He has 20 publications and served as editorial board member and reviewer for multiple journals in the fields of biomedical engineering.

![](images/mas.jpg){width=25%}

Ms. Mar Martinez Mas is a Masterâ€™s student in [Biomedical Engineering at Columbia University](https://www.bme.columbia.edu). She is from Barcelona, Spain, and  completed her undergraduate degree at [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/es/) where sbe worked in the field of biomedical electronics. Afterward, she completed the last year and a half of my degree at the [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it), where she mainly studied the field of biomechanics. Her main interest lies in prosthetic heart valves and life support systems. She joined the Ferrari Lab in 2021.

#### Expandable Polymeric-valved Conduit to Repair Congenital Heart Disease

The proposed research is relevant to public health because a biostable polymeric valved conduit that can be implanted surgically to reconstruct the right ventricular outflow tract in neonates and infants and then expanded by successive transcatheter procedures to reach the adult size, would revolutionize how we treat children with heart valve diseases. Such a new generation of valved conduit would decrease the number of open-heart surgeries and reoperations, decrease the mortality, complications and healthcare costs related to these procedures and increase the life expectancy and quality of life of these patients.
