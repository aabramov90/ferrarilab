# Our Team

## <u>Primary Investigator</u>

 *Giovanni Ferrari, PhD*


![](images/ferrari.jpg){width=25%}

First-generation graduate (U of Pavia, 2003), I am a group leader and Associate Professor (with tenure) at Columbia University, Dept. of Surgery and Biomedical Engineering. I am Scientific Director of the Cardiothoracic Research Program and Director of the Columbia Biobank for Translational Science, an applied biobank supporting translational and precision medicine initiatives. Heart valve and vascular cell physiology, cardiac mechanobiology, materials science in medical devices, and the brain-heart axis are my main research interests.

### Associate Research Scientists

*Esti Castillero, PhD*

![](images/esti.png){width=25%}

I am a Biomedical Researcher with a PhD in Physiology and Endocrinology. My research focuses on the study of the advanced stages of myocardial and cardiac valve remodeling. My research argues that cardiac remodeling is regulated both at a local and systemic level and that it may, in turn, affect remote tissues by endocrine crosstalk. Currently, I am leading projects that explore myocardium-cardiac valve communication in the adaptation to ischemic injury and the role of circulating factors from the skeletal muscle in cardiac remodeling in end-stage heart failure.

#### Expandable Polymeric-valved Conduit to Repair Congenital Heart Disease

The proposed research is relevant to public health because a biostable polymeric valved conduit that can be implanted surgically to reconstruct the right ventricular outflow tract in neonates and infants and then expanded by successive transcatheter procedures to reach the adult size, would revolutionize how we treat children with heart valve diseases. Such a new generation of valved conduit would decrease the number of open-heart surgeries and reoperations, decrease the mortality, complications and healthcare costs related to these procedures and increase the life expectancy and quality of life of these patients.

### Micheal S Sacks PhD

![](images/sacks.jpg){width=25%}

The bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common cardiac congenital anomaly. Due to the widespread availability and routine use of screening echocardiography, development of clinical methods for the identification of asymptomatic young patients with BAV is now realistic. We thus plan to develop sensitive, clinically derivable functional indices that will yield clinically relevant patient- specific strategies for identifying BAV patients at high risk.
