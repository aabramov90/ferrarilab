First-generation graduate (U of Pavia, 2003), I am a group leader and Associate Professor (with tenure) at Columbia University, Dept. of Surgery and Biomedical Engineering. I am Scientific Director of the Cardiothoracic Research Program and Director of the Columbia Biobank for Translational Science, an applied biobank supporting translational and precision medicine initiatives. Heart valve and vascular cell physiology, cardiac mechanobiology, materials science in medical devices, and the brain-heart axis are my main research interests.
